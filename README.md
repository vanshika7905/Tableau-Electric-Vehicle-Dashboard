⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau.

The dashboard analyzes over 150,000 electric vehicles to uncover insights related to market distribution, model growth trends, EV types (BEV vs PHEV), state-wise adoption, and CAFV eligibility.

This is my first Tableau dashboard project, created to strengthen my data visualization and business intelligence skills.
